learning how to create a repository

This is the first respository that I've created in my young coding life.
It has been 3 months since I've set sail on this journey and I'm glad I did.

I have learned alot about computers.
I have learned alot about logic and rational thinking.
I have learned basic html fundamentals.
I am about to begin the css leasson plan on Codecademy.

I'm about halfway through the JavaScript lesson, and boy, is it tough!
I love it though.

Rememeber to always take your time and READ THE DIRECTIONS.
The biggest mistakes are made when we are rushing to solve the problem.
More times than not, that mentality creates more problems.
Find peace in the madness.

Take the proper time to understand the task.
Take the time to prepare the solution.

Be clean.
Be concise.
Be aware.
Be patient.
Be the code.
